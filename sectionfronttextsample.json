But it’s the restaurant’s passion for and execution of Oaxacan dishes, especially those with Oaxacan mole, that have put Ruta on the map. The chicken mole enchiladas are definitive, their tortillas heavily stuffed and heavily smothered by a sauce redolent of cinnamon and smoke, its flavor drawn from weeks of kitchen prep time and centuries of southern Mexican cooking."

It includes dough plus an innovative collection of themed figurines and cool crafts to build imaginary worlds. Kasel’s latest creation is the <a href=\"https://www.newsday.com/app/lifestyle/family/play-snow-recipe-f9f17i11\">snow sensory play kit</a>, available on the website. Kasel shares her recipe: ½ cup baby lotion or regular lotion, 1 cup cornstarch, 2-3 tablespoons glitter (optional) in the color of your choice; silver works well. In a large mixing bowl, mix the cornstarch and lotion until combined. Place it on wax or parchment paper. Knead the dough until it forms a dough-like consistency. It will feel sticky at first but keep at it. If after 10 minutes the dough feels too sticky, add a tablespoon of cornstarch. If it’s too crumbly, add a small amount of lotion at a time and knead it until it feels like snow. Add glitter to make it glisten."

The menu dances between Japanese and Chinese standards, with a section of wok dishes (kung pao chicken, General Tso's, etc.) as well as a respectable dumpling program. There's a dim sum tasting platter ($18) that includes Iberico pork and shrimp shumai, with a deeper savory pork flavor that could stand against the best dim sum houses on Long Island.

In some ways the crown jewel among Anthony Scotto’s meat palaces, it remains the go-to destination for its porterhouse for two or four, bone-in rib-eyes, sirloins and filets mignon. Over the years, however, Blackstone has established a reputation for fine sushi too — recommendations include the Wagyu beef number with lobster, as well as the Vietnam roll, with king crab, lobster, asparagus, avocado, chives, sweet chili sauce, and sriracha, wrapped in rice paper. Towering seafood plateaus feature the freshest ocean fare — from clams to oysters to lobster — while landlubbers ought not pass up the Kobe beef served with a shabu broth. And whatever your persuasion, Blackstone’s banana cream pie and Key lime pie are consistent charmers.

The porterhouse for two, three or even four is the showiest cut of them all, but on equally rich footing are the sirloin, rib steak or filet mignon. You really can’t misstep with prime chops here, but shrimp stuffed with crabmeat or broiled lobsters also await. Meat and seafood eaters alike can convene over potatoes, delivered in almost as many ways as you can think of — mashed, baked, cottage-fried or Lyonnaise-style with crispy onions. Creamed spinach is also a surefire table pleaser. As at many steakhouses, the house bacon cheeseburger is a lunch-only affair — but all times of day are ripe for Key lime or pecan pie.

Devastated by a fire in 2019, it came roaring back the following year, its décor refreshed with new furniture and tiles imported from Portugal as well as a revived outdoor dining area. The menu has hardly changed in 30 years: a carnivorous onslaught of beef sirloin and short ribs, pork spareribs and loin, sausage, chicken and more brought to your table, direct from the charcoal grill and still on the skewer.

These noir cowboy-esque figures (who sharpen their knives daily) will appear at your table whenever you turn a coaster from red to green, shaving slices of at least 13 different kinds of meat, from filet mignon, rib-eye and the signature picanha (or sirloin cap) to lamb steak and linguica sausage, as you grab each flap with little metal tongs. The experience can go on for as long as you like, and also includes unlimited trips to the central “market table” — an icy, glam, gluten-free salad bar in the middle of the room constantly refreshed with salads, hummus, cheeses, fruit, salsas and meats; nearby is a feijoada bar serving up Brazil's signature black bean stew.

But Insignia offers one menu item they don't — and neither does any other steakhouse on the Island: a plant-based steak dubbed the “Unbelievable Vegan Filet Mignon.” Shellfish cocktails and oysters on the half shell suit a round of cocktails, as does tender grilled octopus, or jumbo lump crabcake, or a generously scaled salad. An ample Kansas City sirloin leads the steak brigade, followed by bone-in rib-eye, T-bone or filet mignon. The porterhouse, of course, can feed the table, and the hefty alternative is a steamed two-pound lobster. Black truffle macaroni and cheese is a necessary side, and for dessert, blackberry-mascarpone cheesecake and honey-almond gelato baklava await.

Charles and Franziska Rothmann ran a restaurant that counted former President Theodore Roosevelt as a customer. There have been name and style changes through the years, including a 1970s period when it was <a href=\"https://www.newsday.com/app/entertainment/celebrities/burt-bacharach-inn-restaurant-b43nd3cs\">Burt Bacharach's eatery at the East Norwich Inn</a>. Today, the stars include grilled octopus, kung pao calamari, seared foie gras with balsamic-glazed red onions and blueberry compote, shellfish cocktails, and both sushi and sashimi. The special sushi rolls are multiflavor mouthfuls, surprisingly harmonious. The leading steaks are the porterhouse and the “limited reserve” productions, among them the tomahawk rib-eye, filet mignon and bone-in strip steak. Roasted fingerling potatoes and creamed spinach are the primary sides, along with sauteed onions and hash browns.

Sweeter fare including pancakes, French toast and Belgian waffles can be made “twisted” by adding drizzled chocolate or bananas foster for an extra few dollars.
